        <h2>Understanding Dashing</h2>
        <p>
          Dashing is a force ability that allows you to move quickly and has
          attack properties.
        </p>
        <h3>How to Dash</h3>
        <p>
          Press E with a movement direction inputted (W/A/S/D) to perform a
          dash.
        </p>
        <h3>Dash Parrying</h3>
        <p>
          Parry, then immediately dash to slightly hide the parry animation.
          This can make your parry less predictable and harder to react to while
          you close the distance / bait out attacks.
        </p>
        <h3>Dash Kicks</h3>
        <p>
          Same as dash parrying, but instead of parrying, you kick. This is
          useful for catching your opponent off guard and can be used to get an
          easy stun on an opponent thats further away.
        </p>
        <h3>M1 Dashs</h3>
        <p>
          Similar to dash kicks and dash parries, but you will instead M1 then dash
          afterwards, your saber will swing and you will be able to use its
          hitbox while dashing. You can jump during the dash still as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Dash Snipes</h3>
        <p>
          Dash, then jump and click to perform a quick strike.
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to jump and click when you're next to
          the enemy to time this to actually hit your enemy (If you do it too
          early you will jump over them).

        <h3>Tips for Dashing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Jump while dashing to get more distance if you're using it for
            movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't dash recklessly; it lowers your block, so while fighting don't
            use it to reposition, if you do you might get poked for free and
            it's just a waste of force.
