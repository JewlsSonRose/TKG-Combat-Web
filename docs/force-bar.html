        <h2>Understanding Force Bar</h2>
        <p>
          The force bar is a resource that is consumed when using force
          abilities like dashing, flipping, etc..
        </p>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          Once you have your saber you should see a blue bar above your posture
          bar. When you use a force ability you will see it drain force out of
          this bar. Your force will regenerate when you aren't using force
          abilities.
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Managing Force</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use force abilities appropriately, don't just spam Multi's / Flips
            for 0 value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monitor your force bar when fighting, Multi's specifically consume a
            LOT of force.
          </li>
          <li>
            During Survival make sure you are holding your space bar to
            consistently jump and regenerate force if needed (Prevents some
            kicks from landing / forces enemies to time them).
