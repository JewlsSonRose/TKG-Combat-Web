        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          M1s are basic attacks used by left-clicking. The animation and speed
          depend on your weapon and form (I love Shii-Cho mmmmm).
        </p>

        <h3>Using M1</h3>
        <p>
          Press <code>left click</code> to perform an M1. Timing and spacing are
          important—don’t spam it mindlessly. Also any attack whether it's M1's or Multi's will speed it up the more you land hits so be wary of that timing (Explained further in Multi section)
        </p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can use M1's to bait opponents into parrying by turning away and avoiding their
            hitbox.
          </li>
          <li>
            They also work well for breaking block if your opponent has spammed
            all of their parries and you don't have force
          </li>
