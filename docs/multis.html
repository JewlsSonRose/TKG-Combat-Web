        <h2>Understanding Multi's</h2>
        <p>
          Multi's are fast consecutive dash hits used to deal quick bursts of
          damage. They’re especially useful for punishing stunned opponents but
          come at the cost of high force usage. Also they ramp up just like M1's
          when you successfully land them, so be wary of that timing and learn
          it.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Perform Multi's</h3>
        <p>
          Dash and click to perform a multi. The common input is:
          <code>w → e → Left Click</code>. Don't let go of <code>w</code> before
          you press <code>e</code> to avoid messing up. After you click, release
          <code>w</code> and <code>e</code> to prevent extra movement
          afterwards. The sooner you click after dashing, the sooner your
          character stops moving as dash hits stop you in place so time it well.

        <h3>Tips for Multi's</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Multi's are best used after a stun to punish your opponent with.
          </li>
          <li>
            Double or triple multi's can deal massive damage but are risky if
            not timed well.
          </li>
          <li>
            They consume a lot of force, so don't use them unless you’re sure
            they’ll land.
