        <h2>Understanding Parry / Kick Pips</h2>
        <p>
          Pips are the small diamonds shown on your posture and force bars. They
          represent how many times you can parry or kick before needing to
          recover.
        </p>

        <h3>How They Work</h3>
        <p>
          You have <strong>5 parry pips</strong> on your posture (block) bar and
          <strong>3 kick pips</strong> on your force bar. Each parry or kick
          consumes one pip. They regenerate over time or through specific
          actions.
        </p>

        <h3>Tips for Using Pips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t spam/waste parries or kicks</li>
          <li>
            Keep an eye on your resources—if you run out of pips (Specifically
            parries), you’re in a bad spot and are forced to regen a lot of the
            time
