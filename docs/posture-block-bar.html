        <h2>Understanding Posture / Block Bar</h2>
        <p>
          The posture or block bar shows how much more damage your block can
          take before being broken.
        </p>
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          The bar depletes as you block incoming attacks. If it reaches zero,
          you become stunned longer than the normal stun duration and you can't
          stun evade out. You can regen your posture by not blocking.
        </p>
        <h3>Tips for Managing Posture</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't let your posture bar deplete, fullyâ€”take breaks from blocking
            either by releasing it or attacking more often as your block drops
            when you attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pressure your opponent by attacking their block from time to time to
            create openings don't just sit there if someone is only blocking.
          </li>
        </ul>
