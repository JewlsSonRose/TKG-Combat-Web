        <h2>Understanding Skidding</h2>
        <p>
          Skidding is similar to dashing but you lose control once it starts.
          You'll move in the direction you pressed (W/A/S/D) and can't adjust
          mid-skid. Skids use significantly LESS force than multi's and dashes.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Skid</h3>
        <p>
          While pressing a movement key (W/A/S/D), press <code>c</code> to
          initiate a Skid.
        </p>

        <h3>Skid Parrying</h3>
        <p>
          Parry, then skid right after. This hides some of the parry animation
          and pushes you forward, letting you parry while closing the gap.
        </p>

        <h3>Skid Hits</h3>
        <p>
          Click during a skid to attack. These hits often deal more damage than
          a normal M1 or multi, depending on how fast you're moving. <span style="color: #c237c7; font-weight: bold; background: #f1faee; padding: 2px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">

        <h3>Tips for Skidding</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Because they use less force, Skid Hits are great for breaking blocks
            and quick punishes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine Skid Hits with other mechanics to combo people's posture
            down fast.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mainly use W while Skidding.
