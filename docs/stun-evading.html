        <h2>Understanding Stun Evading</h2>
        <p>
          Stun evading lets you avoid getting slammed (-60+ HP) after being stunned. Instead of tanking 3 multi's you can just evade and make it a lot harder for your opponent to punish you.

        <h3>How to Stun Evade</h3>
        <p>
          You can stun evade by pressing <code>e</code> or <code>c</code> after being stunned (When you see the flash or hear it). Preferably use <code>e</code> as you have more control on where your character is going and it goes further
